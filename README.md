# LLM-Amazon-Customer-Support-Sentiment-Analysis-Model
This repository will develop a sentiment analysis NLP model for Amazon customer support using RNN, CNN, and LLM. Advanced feature engineering and deep learning techniques will be used to analyze customer sentiments and improve support services. Data will be sourced from Kaggle, and model performance will be evaluated for real-world effectiveness.


# Game Plan:

## Data Acquisition:

Data will be pulled from this Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eswarchandt/amazon-music-reviews
The dataset will be explored to understand its structure and content.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

The dataset will be cleaned by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate records.
Data preprocessing will include tokenizing text, removing stop words, and normalizing text data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA will be conducted to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Data visualization using various plots and graphs will provide insights into customer sentiment distribution.
Feature Engineering:

New features will be created based on domain knowledge and insights gained from EDA.
Text features like n-grams, TF-IDF, and word embeddings will be generated for modeling.

## Model Building:

The dataset will be split into training and testing sets.
Various deep learning models such as RNN, CNN, and LLM will be experimented with to determine the best approach.
Cross-validation will be used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model.

## Model Evaluation:

The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Error analysis will be performed to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Model Deployment:

The final model will be saved, and a script for predictions will be created.
The entire process and findings will be documented in a comprehensive report.

## Future Work:

The possibility of incorporating additional data sources to improve model accuracy will be explored.
The project will be kept updated with new findings and improvements.
